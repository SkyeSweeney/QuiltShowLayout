Copy the previous year's folder to a folder for the current year.
Get files from Janice Kagenski
Convert her xls files to csv
Get the data fro the Raffle quilts and make a csv file from them.
Modify the CVSs to get into Entry, Class, Width, Length, Notes order
Append all the CVSs to each other and call Quilts.csv
Sort Quilts.csv first by Class, then length, then width as a starting point.

Change the catagories of the David's house quilts to D so they get hung
together.

Change the class of the quilts that are not Raffle, Davids, or challenge into
XXL(109" and up) XL (97-108) L (85-96) M (49-84) S (0-48). 
This is just a starting point.

Erase all the contents of the overrides.csv file (keep the header)
Start with the Racks.csv file from the previous year.

Make sure the DXF directory exists

Just for fun, run the Quilts.py program to make sure ti runs.
It will generate a bunch of errors for un hung quilts.
Primary cause at this point are a lack of racks of the appropriate class.

The results of this will tell you what you are missing for racks to hang
quilts. In 2024 there were numerous raffle quilts where in 2023 there was only
one. So only one rack was assigned to hold a quilt of class "R". Hence all but
one raffle quilt was not hung. Same sort of thing holds true for other quilts 
and classes as they vary from year to year.

Now look at the previous floor plan and decide what racks will be converted
to what classes to accomodate the current year. Make the adjustements needed
in racks.csv as well as annotating the floor plan. Start with the largest quilts - the ones that need 10'and 9' uprights.
Next consider where special categories (raffle, challenge, Davids House) need to go and what their requirements are.

Run the quilt program and make adjustemts a few more times to get the bulk of
the quilts hung.
